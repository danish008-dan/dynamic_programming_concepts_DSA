Dynamic Programming
===================

Overview
--------
Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique used to
solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems
and storing their results to avoid recomputation.

Topics Covered
--------------
1. Recursion vs Dynamic Programming
2. Fibonacci Sequence
3. Climbing Stairs Problem
4. 0/1 Knapsack Problem

Core Concepts
-------------
- Overlapping Subproblems
- Optimal Substructure
- Memoization (Top-Down)
- Tabulation (Bottom-Up)

Time Complexity Improvement
---------------------------
Recursion: Exponential Time
Dynamic Programming: Polynomial / Linear Time

Why Dynamic Programming
-----------------------
- Improves performance drastically
- Essential for coding interviews
- Used in optimization and decision-making problems

Applications
------------
- Path finding
- Resource optimization
- Scheduling problems
- Competitive programming
